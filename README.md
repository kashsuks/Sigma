# Sigma
A statically-typed, interpreted, brainrot based mix of python, c++, and COBOL.

## Purpose
I built this language to enhance my understanding of compiler design but for dummies. It was also to improve my regular expression skills `re`.

## Keywords/Syntax
- `BEGIN`: Always at the start of the program to begin the code
- `PERIOD`: Always at the end of the program to end the code
- `rob * from sigma`: Importing the interpreter. Similar to what `#include <stdio.h>` does in a C file

### Data Types
- `int`: Integer value
- `float`: Floating point value (decimal)
- `str`: String (including char)
- `bool`: Boolean value (true or false)

### Functions
- `tweak`: Initializing a function. Similar to `def` in python
- `call`: Used to call a function with its requested arguments

### Output
- `yap`: Used to print a value, or a variable to the console. Similar to `print` in python

### Code comments
- `//`: Single line or in-line comments
- `/*` and `*/`: Used to start and end multi-line comments
